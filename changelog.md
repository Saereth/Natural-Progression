# Natural Progression Changelog (1.18.x)

## 2.3.3

### Added:

- New Block Tag to define where Pebbles & Twigs can be placed called `natprog:ground`. By adding blocks to this tag you
  can control where pebbles and twigs are placed in your modpack.

### Changed:

- Create compatibility has been given some love, now supporting Create's new stone blocks to the best of my ability
  given my time restrictions IRL.

### Fixed:

- Pebble and Twig placement being glitchy near / in water

## 2.3.2

### Initial Port to 1.18

### Added:

- Pebbles for Deepslate, Tuff, Dripstone
- Cobbled Tuff
- Cobbled Dripstone
- Crafting recipe for Copper Saw

### Changed:

- All Pebbles (even for mods you don't have installed) are created on launch, but hidden from the player
- Reduced logspam from missing ingredients for recipes (such as an empty tag)
- All stones now drop their cobblestone variants, rather than a handful of pebbles.
