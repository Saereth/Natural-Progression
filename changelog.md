## 2.3.2

### Initial Port to 1.18

### Added:

- Pebbles for Deepslate, Tuff, Dripstone

- Crafting recipe for Copper Saw

### Changed:

- Reduced logspam from missing ingredients for recipes (such as an empty tag)
- All stones now drop their cobblestone variants, rather than a handful of pebbles.
